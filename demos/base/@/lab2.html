                <p>
                  The server and customer interactions from the previous lab can
                  be broken down into a series of activities or events. Based on
                  whether the server is available or busy serving another
                  customer, there are two event transitions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <tt>ARRIVE → SERVE</tt>: a new customer arrives, then gets
                    served immediately; or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <tt>ARRIVE → LEAVE</tt>: a new customer arrives, then
                    leaves.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                We include another event transition:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <tt>SERVE → DONE</tt>: a server is done serving a customer.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Notice that when a customer arrives and a server is available,
                  the <tt>SERVE</tt> event follows right after
                  <tt>ARRIVE</tt> and the <tt>DONE</tt> event occurs sometime in
                  future.
                </p>
                <pre>ARRIVE → SERVE → <i>after some time...</i><!-- &hellip; --> → DONE
</pre>

                <p>
                  An event occurs at a particular time, and each event alters
                  the state of the system and may generate more events. We call
                  this a <i>discrete event simulator</i> as states remain
                  unchanged between two events, which allows the simulation to
                  jump from the time of one event to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Processing events <i>in the right way</i> requires the use of
                  an event priority queue. While Java provides the
                  <tt>PriorityQueue</tt> class which is a mutable collection
                  (like <tt>ArrayList</tt>), we have provided our own
                  <tt>PQ</tt> class that is immutable, as well as an
                  accompanying <tt>Pair</tt> class.
                </p>

                <p>
                  During the lecture, we have seen how an <tt>ImList</tt> of
                  integers can be sorted by passing an integer
                  <tt>Comparator</tt> to the <tt>sort</tt> method.
                </p>
                <pre>
jshell&gt; List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ImList&lt;Integer&gt;(List.of(1, 2, 3))
list ==&gt; [1, 2, 3]

jshell&gt; class IntComp implements Comparator&lt;Integer&gt; {
   ...&gt;    public int compare(Integer i, Integer j) { 
   ...&gt;       return j - i; 
   ...&gt;    }
   ...&gt; }
|  created class IntComp

jshell&gt; list.sort(new IntComp())
list ==&gt; [3, 2, 1]

                >

                <p>
                  Similarly, a priority queue requires a sort order in which to
                  prioritize elements in the queue. The following shows how a
                  <tt>PQ</tt> of integers can be constructed by passing in an
                  integer <tt>Comparator</tt>.
                </p>
                <pre>
jshell&gt; PQ&lt;Integer&gt; pq = new PQ&lt;Integer&gt;(new IntComp())
pq ==&gt; []
</pre
                >

                <p>
                  We can add elements to the priority queue via the
                  <tt>add</tt> method.
                </p>
                <pre>
jshell&gt; pq.add(1)
$.. ==&gt; [1]

jshell&gt; pq // note that pq is immutable
pq ==&gt; []

jshell&gt; pq = pq.add(1).add(2).add(3)
pq ==&gt; [3, 1, 2]
</pre
                >

                <p>
                  You will also notice that the output of elements in a priority
                  queue is not necessarily in order. What matters most is the
                  values returned from the <tt>poll</tt> method.
                </p>
                <pre>
jshell&gt; pq.poll()
$.. ==&gt; (3, [2, 1])
</pre
                >

                <p>
                  Due to the immutable nature of <tt>PQ</tt>, the
                  <tt>poll</tt> method requires two <i>values</i> to be
                  returned, the highest priority element as well as the priority
                  queue after removing the element. These are encapsulated in a
                  generic <tt>Pair</tt> object, and the individual values can be
                  retrieved via the <tt>first</tt> and <tt>second</tt> methods.
                </p>
                <pre>
jshell&gt; Pair&lt;Integer, PQ&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; pr = pq.poll()
pr ==&gt; (3, [2, 1])

jshell&gt; pr.first()
$.. ==&gt; 3

jshell&gt; pq = pr.second()
pq ==&gt; [2, 1]
</pre
                >

                <p>
                  The following shows how the priority queue can be subsequently
                  polled until the queue becomes empty.
                </p>
                <pre>
jshell&gt; pr = pq.poll()
pr ==&gt; (2, [1])

jshell&gt; pq = pr.second()
pq ==&gt; [1]

jshell&gt; pq.isEmpty()
$.. ==&gt; false

jshell&gt; pr = pq.poll()
pr ==&gt; (1, [])

jshell&gt; pq = pr.second()
pq ==&gt; []

jshell&gt; pq.isEmpty()
$.. ==&gt; true

                <p>
                  We are now ready to process our events using <tt>PQ</tt>. As
                  usual, we create arrival events for all customer arrival and
                  service times. However, rather than processing them right
                  away, we add them into a priority queue that is ordered in
                  terms of events. Events are ordered by earliest occurrence of
                  the event, and in the case of ties, by order in which the
                  customer arrives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having included all arrival events in the priority queue, we
                  can begin processing the queue:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>poll an event from the queue</li>
                  <li>
                    if necessary, generate the next event using the current
                    state of the server and add into the queue
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Repeate the above until the queue is empty. Remember to update
                  the server along the way.

                <p>
                  As the problem increases in complexity, you have to learn how
                  to simplify the original problem so that you can solve them
                  incrementally. For example, using JShell
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    start by experimenting with the <tt>PQ</tt> and be familiar
                    with how <tt>add</tt> and <tt>poll</tt> works. You can just
                    follow through the preamble section of this document.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    define a general event class with a timestamp and experiment
                    with the <tt>PQ</tt> of events.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    make the event class a parent and include arrival event as
                    the child; don't worry about the other events. At this point
                    of time, your event <tt>PQ</tt> should just work (adding and
                    polling) with arrival events since arrival events are
                    events.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    include the leave event (since it's simplest) such that when
                    an arrival event gets polled, it should generate a leave
                    event and add to the <tt>PQ</tt>. This leave event should be
                    the next one polled from the <tt>PQ</tt>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    till now, we did not pay much attention to the status of the
                    servers. Include the serve event (skip done event for the
                    moment) which will update the "state" of the servers. Think
                    of how the "update" should be done in order to make it
                    effect-free. Since a new state of servers has to be created,
                    think of how to include this into <tt>PQ</tt> processing
                    which ultimately drives the simulation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    if you are able to reach this point, you will realize that
                    the output of your program will be no different from the
                    previous lab. Now it is a matter of including the done
                    event.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Although you could have gotten the correct output without
                  using events and/or the priority queue, do note that there
                  will be more events later, so it is always good to prepare
                  early.
